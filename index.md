# About me

Since October 2014, I am an associate professor (maître de conférences, HDR) at [University Jean Monnet](https://portail.univ-st-etienne.fr){:target="_blank"} of Saint-Etienne (France).
I work at [Hubert Curien Laboratory](http://laboratoirehubertcurien.fr){:target="_blank"} in the [Data Intelligence team](https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/teams/data-intelligence.html){:target="_blank"}. I am in charge of the 2nd year of BSc in Computer Science since July 2015 and of the 1st year since 2024. From October 2013 to September 2014, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/){:target="_blank"} (Institute of Science and Technology Austria) in the [Christoph Lampert group](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/){:target="_blank"} (Computer Vision and Machine Learning).

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science (machine learning) at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale](https://www.lis-lab.fr){:target='_blank'} (now LIS) of Marseille in the [Qarma team](https://qarma.lis-lab.fr){:target="_blank"}, under the direction of [Amaury Habrard](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/habrarda/){:target='_blank'} and [Stéphane Ayache](https://stephane-ayache.pedaweb.univ-amu.fr/wordpress/){:target='_blank'}. The main objective of my thesis was to study the learning of majority vote for supervised classification and domain adaptation. This work was supported by the ANR project VideoSense. I was also a member of PASCAL2 Network of Excellence.
